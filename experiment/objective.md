The purpose of this lab is to make students familiar with the concept of protein aggregation. In the unfolded state a protein undergo aggregation. And CD spectroscopic methods provides us a nice way to determine that. By doing this experiment user will be able to,


    1. Understand how at unfolded state a protein undergoes aggregation.
    2. Understand how CD spectroscopic methods are useful to determine aggregation effect.
    3. Experience how environmental conditions control the aggregation effect.
    4. Understand how comparative study of Dynode voltage helps to determine whether aggregation has taken place or not.
