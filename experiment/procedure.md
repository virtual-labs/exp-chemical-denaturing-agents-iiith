Step2 : Follow the instructions given in the Experiemntal-setup page.

Step3 : Select the temperature range and step size of your interest.

Step4 : Go through the instructions and fill up the table by clicking at the 222nm.

Step5 : Observe the plot and find out the transition temperature.

Step6 : Click on the "Measure Dynode Voltage".

Step7 : Follow the instruction and fill up the table by clicking at the 222nm.

Step8 : Observe the change in Dynode voltage.

Step9 : Click on "Go to Analysis"

Step 10 : Submit your answers. You can verify them from redoing the experiment or going through the theory.
